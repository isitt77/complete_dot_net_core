    <h3>Features Added</h3>
    <p>Because this is a demo app, I’ve added some UX/UI assistance that provides you with a dummy credit card number and simple instructions for when you place your order. </p>
    <p>You can verify in Stripe’s documentation that it is one of their test numbers.</p>

    <p>I’ve also created a Light Mode / Dark Mode theme you can toggle between on the main menu. This will switch between two Bootstrap themes and will also be applied to third party pop-up alerts.</p>*@

@*<h3>Register / Login</h3>
